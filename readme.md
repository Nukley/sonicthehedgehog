NOTE: this repository has no relation with the Sonic-1-2-2013-Decompilation project.
 
All rights go to Sega with no original source code or files being modified but instead being powered by a new open source engine to keep the game alive while allowing the game to be freely ported to multiple platforms without closed source engine limitations or being stuck on a certain platform/architecture.
